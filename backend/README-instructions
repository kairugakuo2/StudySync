## Backend - Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the backend locally:

1. cd backend
2. npm install
3. npm start

Once the server is running, open `http://localhost:3000/ping` in your browser or run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/ping
```

You should see:

```json
{ "message": "pong" }
```

For live-reload during development, you can use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
